intro: These are the general-purpose background tracks included with and created for <em>johnnydmad</em>, using its built-in custom sample set as well as occasional, limited extra sample imports for specific purposes.

title: johnnydmad Legacy
intro: These tracks are carried over from <em>johnnydmad</em>'s predecessors, <em>Beyond Chaos EX</em> and <em>nascentorder</em>. They use a combination of Final Fantasy VI vanilla samples and a custom sample set originally based on <em>FF6 T-Edition</em>'s. The long-term goal is to eventually replace all of these with updated versions using the newer <em>johnnydmad</em> sample set.

title: Tierboss fragments
intro: The first three phases of the final boss fight ("tiers") use one logical music track that advances between three sections as you progress through the fight. The randomizer picks three pieces from this list and arranges them in random order to create a new set of three boss musics. Because it is only loaded as a single track, each of these fragments has significantly more stringent requirements on memory for both the sequence and the samples used. Therefore, the list here is missing a lot of the fancier fun battle themes that are more demanding on memory, and samples are heavily shared while keeping to the original organs-and-choirs aesthetic.

title: johnnydmad Victory
intro: Musical pieces that play after winning in battle, usually either a short repeating fanfare designed for the purpose, or a longer track that has a fanfare-like introduction. Since the fanfare is one of the few times that music loading time is plainly visible to the player, tracks that are used both in victory and elsewhere often have victory-specific variants that are adjusted to use less sample memory, and therefore shorter load times.
